# The Importance of Descriptive Statistics

Let's say that we have in front of us a stream of data that we'd say has some degree of randomnes. Acknowledging that is not entirely deterministic is not saying much, actually. We might want to describe it in a bit more detail.

As we usually do in _Data Science_, we tend to describe the outcome of that random variable trhough its quantification. The definition of a random variable as a measurable function is beautiful from a mathematical point of view, but it doesn't really tell you much. How do we normally describe random variables?

The first and most elementary concept for describing a random variable is its *distribution*, or its *cumulative distribution*. The cumulative distribution is actually very straight-foward to understand. We could say that it is the probability _p(x)_ for our random variable of being under some value _x_.

Or,

$$F(x) = P(X(\omega) \leq x)$$.
