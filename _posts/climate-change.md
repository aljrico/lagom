Science is one of the greatest achievements of humanity. Has proven to be the most reliable and accurate methodology for assessing truth and knowledge we have ever known. It grows with painstaking research that is build-up on top of previous evidence gradually updated, challenged, refined and improved over time. This means that, by its very nature, it can be painfully slow, unhurried and time-consuming. 

This complex nature of most discoveries and the inherent slowness of research opens a remarkable breach between the scientific community and the modern media age. Especially once politics intoxicate the topic.

*Climate Change* has stood out as a prominent and clear example of the mess derived from mixing hysterical modern media, political interests, mass misinformation and an extremely complex topic.  

In this article I aim to outline what we *really* know about climate change and how is that we know it.
