title: The usage of Behaviorism in videogames

Have you ever feel the sensation of playing a videogame *way* past the point where was fun? Have you ever finished a game, and then looked back a few weeks later and thought *"What the hell was I doing with my life"*? 
Why does that happens? Because some games are strongly build around reward schedules, where its design is aimed to make you continually repeat dulling and tedious tasks that has long lost its novelty, creating the illusion of engagement. Many action games use this system to convince players to smash the same buttons for 12 hours straight.

You can spot some of this techniques in random loot drops, grinding of monsters, leveling up, farming, loot boxes, etc. Persuading you to stay for just one more prize, even though you have been long bored and sleepy . Almost anything with a points system uses this strategy. 

It does not finish with points, but with anything that has a clear and manifest reward.

In this article I want to talk about how games can condition behaviour.

In the early 30's, Burrhus Frederic Skinner began studying psycology in a ground-breaking new way. What is now called *Radical Behaviorism*

Before him, we already knew how to condition immediate reactions. This means we had the psycological necessary knowledge to induce fear, hungry, sadness and many other reactions on topics at disposal. Like get a guy terrified of pencils or induce him extreme hsadness over pumpkins.

The point of this power is that it was limited to immediate and not well-thought reactions, not rational decisions. The radical point of Skinner is that rational and logical decisions can be so induced too. In fact, Skinner gone so far as to stating that there is no real *free will*, and that every decision is the outcome of the consequences of previous decisions.

These discoveries of Skinner, and how this knowledge can be used to change the way people make choices, has been widely and very smartly used in the videogames industry.

# The Skinner Box

Skinner performed a brilliand and simple experiment. He created a machine that consisted on a simple closed box with a button inside it that automatically let some food in. The point of the experiment was to introduce a pigeon inside the box and record the evolution in its behaviour.

What happened is that Skinner proofed that he could condition the decision making of the piegon. Because pecking the button was not a reaction to stimulae, it was learned behaviour. This is called operant conditioning.

More importantly, he found out that operant conditioning can be applied on humans too.

Further research showed even more impressive conclusions: The best way to convince someone to continuously do an action is not to give him a reward immediately after, but to recompense him a random number of times he performed that action, or just scattered in time. These methods happened to be far more effective.

This usually can be seen in gambling. We all know that gambling games are not rigged in favour of the gambler, and the gamblers are well aware of that too. So why they do keep playing? Consider asking yourself something: Whould you rather prefer spending 8 hours in a casino playing blackjack and ending with 100€, or pushing a button in a factory for the same time amount of time but ending with 110€? Which activity would people tell you is more fun?

# Conditioning

Skinner also set rewards based on conditioners that can be used to reinforce behaviour. Now we need to understand the main differences between two types of reinforces:

- Primary Reinforces are what we are used to call *biological* needs or fundamental. Food, water, sleep, sexual desire, etc. The effect of the reward from this conditioners might have a huge effect, but it utterly diminishes once the person reaches satiation or the biological limit of their needs.

- Secondary Reinforces. On the other hand, we have those needs that land out of the biological realm. Like social approvation, sense of power or money. These things do not hit a satiation point. Some argue that trying to fulfill this unappeasable needs is what fuels the human progress and creativity.

Interestingly enough, those secondary needs are considered proxy achievements in order to eventually be able to get the primary ones.

Too many games uses rewarding Skinner techniques as a catch, as a cover to delay your realisation of how terrible, boring and uninspired they are.

The point of understanding how behaviourism is used in videogames is that there are other better ways to stimulate engagment. Not just simple Skinner Box satisfaction cons, tricks, hustles, hoodwinks, gamgbits, flimflams, strategem and bamboozles the system rewards you with.

Games can foster engagement by applying more interesting and immversive mechanics, as:

- **Compelling Narrative**. Have you ever wanted to get lost in a world? Continue reading a book, watching a move or playing a videogame just because you wanted to be in that universe? This is what great masterpieces achieve, in any genre. The *Wizarding World* of Harry Potter, the *Middle Earth* of the Lord of the Rings, the world of Skyrim, the post-apocalyptic scenario of the Fallout series, etc. It is not even necessary to build a complete *Legendarium*, you just need to develop interesting and complleing plots to keep people engaged. Unravelling and solving mysteries can be as compelling and rewarding as any cold skinner-boxy compensation system.

- **Mastery**. We all like to practice, learn and improve our expertise when playing a game. Players can be engaged just by having the opportunity of masterying their skills and utilising their mastery to overcome challenges. This can be well implemented in simple fighting games like the *Street Fighters* saga and most shooters, more complex ones like the *Dark Souls*, or with mental challenges like in *Portal* or the *Civilization* games.

I am not saying behaviourism is a bad thing or a methodology to be entirely avoided. All honest and compelling design strategies can be fairly enhanced using Skinner-Box techniques, making the game more exciting and engaging. But we need to get rid of this increasing reliance on behaviourism methods just to trick the players into a compulsive non-compelling gaming. 

We can do better than that.
