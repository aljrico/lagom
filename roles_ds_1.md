In this post I will try exemplify how **Data Science** can be of great
help when trying to address real-world problems. Today we'll optimize
drugs distribution of some uknown place, just looking at the raw data
provided by the medical services in place.

Even though we are not trying to usurpe the role of Physicians in their
field, we'll try to show how useful can be the application of Data
Science techniques in order to *cooperate* with Medical Services.
Especially in scenarios of scarcity or emergency, where medical
specialists are having a hard time dealing with huge loads of people in
need of their help. In this extreme situations, decision-making
processes are more critical than ever.
